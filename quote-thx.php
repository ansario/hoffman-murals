					<p>Every artist believes their work is priceless. Some muralists calculate their fee by the hour while others do it by the square foot - Hoffman Murals provides free consultation to all of our clients. Upon accepting a commission, the client will receive a detailed sketch with multiple options. After the second consultation, a price will be quoted. This quote is determined by the complexity of the design, the space being considered and the amount of time estimated to complete the mural.</p>
					<p>On average, most of the mural work completed by Hoffman Murals ranges between 2-10 days with a cost of $1,200/day. Please understand that you are commissioning an artist to complete a one of a kind original artwork designed to your aesthetic preference and space. One could easily spend a few thousand dollars on a small easel painting! Total price includes initial sketches, all labor, materials and two coats of a polyurethane finish (optional for residential clients).</p>
					<p>Payment procedure is 10% down upon acceptance of initial design and cost, the next 40% due at beginning of mural project and the final 50% due upon acceptance of work completed. Mural site is to be properly prepared and ready upon start date.  Delays due to client or additional preparation work are additional fees.</p>
